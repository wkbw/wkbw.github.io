        <p class="lead">
       Hi, my name is Wendy Byerly. I grew up all along the US West Coast but eventually settled in Spokane, WA. I’m the youngest of four daughters and the last to leave Spokane when I went to Western WA University in Bellingham, WA. I graduated with a degree in Political Science then moved to Seattle and haven't left since. Most of my work experience is with design and web technologies (HTML, SGML, XML, CSS) but unfortunately not much JavaScript. I took a five year detour into the restaurant & bar industry to support the family business. However, I found hospitality is not my forte, so I started working for a non-profit 10 years ago as a Salesforce Admin where I work today.</p>

       <p class="lead">The Pandemic has changed life for all of us, but for me, most of the changes occurred in the last 12 months. Summer 2021 saw the youngest of my three daughters graduate from High School, then I married the best man I’ve every known in the Nevada desert at dawn. Fall was trying with many health issues but Winter was the hardest as my mom passed away on December 24, 2021. She was amazing, after I left for college, she too went back to school and got her BS in Accounting then got her CPA at the age of 55. That was one way she inspired me to enroll in the Professional Certificate in Coding.</p>

       <p class="lead">I’m fortunate to work from home where I can study as well as work. My four coworkers are pretty cool, although they do stare at me when I eat lunch and get overly excited when Amazon deliveries anything, especially if it’s stuffed toy ducks or any form of dog bone.</p>

       <p class="lead">I love the work I do now, but am really looking forward to growing into a “real” software developer.</p>
